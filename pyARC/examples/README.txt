This folder contains some simple routine to demonstrate the basic usage of pyARC with pyATMO.

** PrepDataset
Uses pyATMO to generate a synthetic dataset. Note that it requires the ATMO executable
to be located in the working directory.

** InstallNamelistParameters
Contains the definitions for parameters used by ATMO.

** RunEmcee
Demonstrates how to use pyARC to do an atmospheric retrieval using a built-in log likelihood
function for a clear, isothermal atmosphere in chemical equilibrium. It uses pyATMO to do this.
